        I document life, places, the intimacy of people and love what I do. Is very important to me to have a narrative behind every shoot that I take, therefore my work shows an honest portrayl of feelings and expressions. I like to work in a natural environment with a previous planning and I love to give a warming welcome to my clients and making them feel part of the process and the session.
